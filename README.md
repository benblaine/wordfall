# Word-Fall Reading Game

This is a simple web game designed to help kids learn to read by recognizing and pronouncing short sentences displayed on the screen. Sentences fall from the top of the screen, and the player must say the sentence to make it disappear before it reaches the bottom. The game ends when the sentences reach the top of the screen.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Short sentences will start falling from the top of the game area every 2 seconds.
3. Use your voice to say the sentence correctly. If the Web Speech API detects a match, the sentence will disappear.
4. Each spoken sentence will be displayed in the transcription area on the right.
5. The game ends when the sentences stack up to the top of the game area.
